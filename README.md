### Hi there 👋, It's Md Roknuzzaman
#### I'm a Web Developer

👋 Hey there! I'm **Md Roknuzzaman** — a Full-Stack Developer with 2.5 years of experience turning ☕ into scalable code.

🛠️ By day, I’m a Junior Software Engineer at Annon IT, wrangling JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, and Docker into submission. By night, I’m either debugging my life or exploring new tech stacks like it’s a side quest.

📦 My backend superpowers include:
- **Express.js**, **TypeORM**, **Sequelize**, **Mongoose**
- **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **MongoDB** — I speak fluent CRUD in both SQL and NoSQL
- Auth? I got you. From **FusionAuth** to **Auth0**, I make sure nobody sneaks in without credentials.

🎨 On the frontend side:
- I speak **React** and sprinkle in some **Next.js** magic for SSR goodness
- My styling mood swings between **SCSS** and **Tailwind CSS**, depending on caffeine level
- Currently obsessed with **Shadcn UI** and all things component-driven

🚀 I'm also diving deep into:
- Microservices, Docker, and Kubernetes (because who doesn’t love containers within containers?)
- Building SaaS products, e-learning platforms, and sometimes debugging why I exist in production

😄 Fun fact: I treat Git like a diary and commit messages like poetry.

Let’s connect, collaborate, and maybe write a few thousand lines of bugs together — I mean code. ✨
