### Hi there 👋, It's Md Roknuzzaman
#### I'm a Web Developer

👋 Hi, it's Md Roknuzzaman, a Junior Software Engineer with a strong passion for web development. In less than a year in the field, I've become proficient in React, Typescript, Node.js, Express.js, TypeORM, and Mongoose, and I have experience working with both relational and non-relational databases.

🔐 I'm well-versed in Fusion Auth, adding a layer of security and authentication to my projects. My UI skills include SCSS for styling and an appreciation for the utility-first approach using Tailwind CSS.

🚀 Currently, I'm expanding my skill set with Next.js to build performant, server-rendered React applications. My journey in technology is a constant learning process, and I'm always excited to explore new challenges.
