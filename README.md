### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, It's Md Roknuzzaman
#### I'm a Web Developer

Highly motivated entry-level Web Developer who is actively looking for a job position similar to Junior Front-End Developer/ Junior Full Stack Developer (MERN Stack). 

Ready to join a team with a great working and learning environment so that I can contribute to the company I will be working for in every aspect. 

Have built some projects with React.js and MERN stack where I implemented Firebase Authentication, CRUD operation, and developed Admin dashboard. Made all the projects mobile-friendly and responsive using either Bootstrap or TailwindCSS.

Skills: JS / REACT / EXPRESS / MONGODB / HTML / CSS
